# Zorth: Forth for the Zeal 8-bit OS
Zorth is a free Forth interpreter written from scratch for the Zeal 8-bit OS. 

Currently execute most of the CORE words, plus some extensions:

Zorth follows the ![Forth Standard](https://forth-standard.org/standard/core) specifications and takes ![gForth](https://gforth.org/) as a reference. You can use both as documentation.

This repository contains:

- prod/zorth.bin, the file needed to run Forth or make your own os_with_romdisk.img
- prod/os_with_romdisk.img, for running on the real hardware.
- assembler source files if you have interest in it.

## Status ##

This project is in beta. It runs in my machine, but needs users to fully test it.

## How to run it in the emulator ##

You only need the file `prod/zorth.bin`.

In the emulator, type `cd h:/` and then select the PC directory where you copied the file.
Now you have access to your PC directory from the emulador.

In the emulator, type `exec zorth.bin` and voila!

## How to run on the Zeal 8-bit board ##
You can load `prod/os_with_romdisk.img` onto your board. This contains the Zeal 8 bits OS plus zorth.bin and forth.fs on drive A:

You can create your own image, packaging zorth.bin onto the romdisk while compiling the OS and then loading the image.

## How compile source files ##

I use the Z80 Assembler from project [z88dk](https://github.com/z88dk/z88dk). You only need `z80asm` file.

Compile with `z80asm -Iinclude -s -l -m -g -b zorth.asm`

## Extensions ##

**asciiz** ( c-addr1 u c-addr2 -- c-addr2 ) \ Converts text c-addr1 u to asciiz in c-addr2 
    
**2hex** ( x -- ) Displays x as two hex digit.

**4hex**  ( x -- ) Displays x as four hex digit.

**clear** ( -- )  Clears the screen.

**clearstack** ( i * x -- ) Clears the data stack

**dict**  ( -- addr ) Address of dictionary pointer (to last entry).

**heap** ( -- addr ) Address of heap pointer.

**hide** ( -- ) Remove the last word of the dictionary, but keeps xt valid. 

**ioctl** ( device_number command_number param -- flag ) Execute a IOCTL.

**jz** ( x -- ) If x is zero, jump to the address in the next cell.

**jmp** ( -- ) Jump to the address in the next cell.

**>cs** ( x -- : C -- x ) Push TOS to the control stack

**cs>** ( -- x : C x -- ) Pops x from control stack and pushes it into the data stack.

**cs@** ( -- x : C x -- x ) Fetch x from control stack and pushes into the data stack.

**noop** ( -- ) No operation

**unused** ( -- x ) RAM free space (in bytes)

**-rot** ( w1 w2 w3 â€“ w3 w1 w2 ) \ gforth

**same-page** ( x -- ) guarantees that the next n bytes will be on the same page in memory
